Q2:
Since the latency of L1, L2 and L3 are added to approximately 160ms, the latency would be around 160ms. 
The path from h1 to h4 is linked from L1 to L3 and out of the three is minimized to 20Mbps. 

Q3: 
From h7 to h9, the average RTT is 161.777ms and throughput is 22.8 Mbits/sec.
From h4 to h10, the average RTT is 162.089ms and throughput is 12.8 Mbits/sec.

From h10 to h4, the average RTT is 161.833ms and throughput is 20.9 Mbits/sec.
From h9 to h1, the average RTT is 161.873ms and throughput is 11.0 Mbits/sec.
From h7 to h8, the average RTT is 161.810ms and throughput is 6.21 Mbits/sec.

For all of the pairs of nodes, the paths from s1 to s4 would take around 160ms for latency, and the throughput would be 20 Mbits/sec.
This is resulted from Latency which is calculated by the accumulated time from L1 to L3 whereas throughput is the minimum bandwidth between L1 to L3.
From my predictions, for both two and three pairs are similarly by all of the average RTT and throughput for the first pairs.
Although as the other pairs were communicating simultaneously, the throughput for each decreased. 
It takes multiple signals and combining them into one, and this decrement in throughput happened is resulted from multiplexing
The use of it enhanced the connection and reduced the time in communicating.

Q4:

From h1 to h4, the latency would be around 160 ms due to the accumulated latency from L1 to L3 is around 160ms.
The throughput would be around 20 Mbits/sec since it depends on the minimal throughput between L1 to L4. 
From h5 to h6, the latency would be approximately 45ms and the throughput would be around 20 Mbits/sec. 
The throughput would be lower than the least throughput found between L2 and L5 resulted from multiplexing from the previous pair.
Thus, h1 to h4 has an average RTT of 161.840ms and a throughput of 20.4 Mbits/sec.
As for h5 to h6, its average RTT is 41.687ms and throughout is 22.6 Mbits/sec. 
These measurements turn out to be pretty close to my prediction as well.
